\opgave{7f}{Show that the quotient $\bar{R} = R/M$ of a ring $R$ by a maximal two sided ideal $M \subset R$ is a simple ring.}
Let $\pi : R \to \bar{R} : r \mapsto \bar{r}$. Let $N$ be a nonzero ideal of $\bar{R}$. Then $\pi^{-1}(N)$ is an ideal of $R$ (strictly) containing $M$, so that $\pi^{-1}(N)=R$. So N= R/M = \bar{R}$.
