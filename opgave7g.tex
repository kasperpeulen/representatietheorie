\opgave{7g}{Explain that a simple ring $R$ is always an algebra over some field.}
Suppose that we would know that center of $R$ is a field. Well then we've got a ringhomomorphism 
\[Z(R) \to Z(R) : r \mapsto r .\]
And by definition this makes $R$ a field. So we can prove the proposition by proving the following lemma.
