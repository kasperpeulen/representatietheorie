We need to show that there exists a unique monic polynomial $m_A$ of minimal degree such that $m_A(A)=0$ and if $p(x)$ is any polynomial satisfying $p(A)=0$, then $p$ is divisble by $m_A$ (as a polynomial).

It is clear that such monic polynomials $p$ with $p(A)$ exist. So there will be one such polynomial of minimal degree. Now assume $p$ and $p'$ were two such monic polynomials of minimal degree with $p(A)=p'(A)=0$. Then we would have $(p-p')(A)=p(A)-p'(A)=0$. If $p=p'$, then we can divide $p-p'$ by its leading coefficient, leading to a monic polynomial $q$ of smaller degree than $p$ and $p'$ with $q(A)=0$, contradicting the minimality of the degree. 

Now let $p$ be any polynomial such that $p(A)=0$. There are polynomials $q,r$ with $\deg(r)<\deg(m_A)$ such that $p=qm_A+r$. Then $r(A)=0$, but then $r$ must be $0$ otherwise, $m_A$ wouldn't be of minimal degree. Therefore $p=qm_A$.
