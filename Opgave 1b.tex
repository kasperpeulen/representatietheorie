\opgave{1b}{Show that there exists a canonical injective linear map $i:V \to V^{**}$.}
Define this map as $i:v \mapsto V^*\to k : \phi \mapsto \phi(v)$.
Linearity follows from the linearity from elements of $V^*$ and from the linearity of elements of $V^{**}$.
Suppose that $v,w \in V$ such that $i(v)=i(w)$. In other words, for all $\phi in $,V^*$ $\phi(v)=\phi(w)$. As $\phi$ is linear, $\phi(v-w)=0$. But we know from 1a, that there exist a $\phi$ such that $\phi(v-w) \neq 0$ if $v-w \neq 0$. Therefore $v-w$ must be zero, and so $v=w$, as required.
