\opgave{4b}{Show that \bigoplus_{i\in I} V_i is a linear subspace}
Suppose that $(v_i)_{i\in I},(w_i)_{i \in I} \in \bigoplus_{i\in I} V_i$. Then $v_i \neq 0$ for all $i$ in a finite set $N$ and $w_i \neq 0 $ for all $i$ in a finite set $M$. So $v_i+w_i \neq 0$ for all $i$ in a subset of $N\cup M$. As $N\cup M$ is finite as well, $(v_i+w_i)_{i\in I}$ is also in $\bigoplus_{i\in I} V_i$.
