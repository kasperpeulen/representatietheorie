\opgave{1a}{Recall the representation of $k[X]$ as in Exercise 8(c) of Week 36. Explain that
any finite dimensional representation $V$ of $k[X]$ is of this form.}

Let $V$ be a finite dimensional representation of $k[X]$. Then there exists a ringhomomorphism $\rho: k[X] \to \End_k(V)$, we are going to show that $X.v = Av$ for some $A \in \End_k(V)$ for all $v\in V$. But this follows directly as $\rho$ maps $X$ to an element $A\in \End_k(V)$.
