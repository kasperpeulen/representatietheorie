\opgave{7a}{If $V$ is a $k$-vector space then $\End_k(V)$ is a $k$-algebra. Explain this statement.}
We need to find a ring homomorphism $k \to Z(\End_k(V))$. Let $B$ a basis for $V$. We know that $1\in k$ must map to $I \in \End_k(V)$. We know that $\alpha \in k$ must map to $\alpha \cdot I$, otherwise, we won't end up with a ringhomomorphism. To show that with this definition the ring homomorphism properties hold:
\[(k_1+k_2) I=k_1\cdot I + k_2 \cdot I \quad \quad (k_1 \cdot k_2)I= k_1 I \cdot k_2 I  \]
