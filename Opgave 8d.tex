\opgave{8d}{Show that the homomorphism $\lambda: k[X] \to \End_k(V) : p \mapsto p(A)$ corresponding to the $k[X]$-module strucutre of $V$ as in (c) has a nontrivial kernel.}
So we need to show that there exists a polynomial $f \neq 0$ such that $f(A) = 0$. In other words, $f(A).v$ must be $0$ for all $v\in V$. So $\sum_{i=0}^n a_i (A(v))^i$ must be $0$ where some $a_i$ are non-zero. If all $(A(v))^i$ where L.I. this would be impossible, so apperently, we need to show that $(A(v))^i$ are linear dependent and that we can choose $a_i$ so that $\sum_{i=0}^n a_i (A(v))^i=0$. How can we show this ?

Or... I take $p(x)=\det(xI-A)$. Then, according to Mr. Cayley and Mr. Hamilton, $p(A)$ must be equal to $0$.
