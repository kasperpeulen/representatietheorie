\opgave{8c}{Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $k$-vector space and let $A \in \End_k(V)$. Show that $V$ admits a unique $k[X}$-module structure such that $X.v = A(v)$ for all $v\in V$}

So we need to show there is only way to define $f.v$ if $X.v=Av$ for all $v \in V$. But because of the properties of the action (induced by the ring homomorphism) and because of the linearity of this action, we get:
\[f.v=(\sum_{i=0}^n a_i X^i).v = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i (X.v)^i = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i (A(v))^i \]

So there is only one way to define this action.
