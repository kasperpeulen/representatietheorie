\opgave{8b}{If $k$ is a field, show that the concepts $k$-module and $k$-vector space are identical.}
($\Leftarrow$) If $V$ is a $k$-vector space. Then $V$ is an abelian group. We want to show that $V$ is a $k$-module, and therefore we define the action of $k$ on $V$ as $\alpha.v=\alpha\cdot v$ where $\cdot$ is scalar multiplication. The desired properties follow now directly out of the definition of a vector space.

($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $M$ is a $k$-module. We need to show that $M$ is a $k$-vector space. Again, if we define scalar multiplication $\cdot$ as $\alpha \cdot v= \alpha .v$, where $.$ is the action of $k$ on $V$, then the desired properties follow directly from the ring homomomorphism properties (that induce this action).
