\opgave{7e}{A simple, commutative ring $R$ is a field.}
Suppose $a \in R - 0$. Then $aR$ us a non-zero two sided ideal of $R$, and since $R$ is simple, $aR$ must be equal to $R$. And since $1 \in R$, it should be possible to write $1=ar$ for some $r \in R$. Which makes $R$ a division ring, and since $R$ it is commutative, $R$ is a field.
