\opgave{2a}{Show that $\beta^* := {b^* : b \in \beta} \subset V^*$ is a linearly independent set.}
Assume there are scalars such that $$\sum_{b^*\in\beta^*} a_{b^*}b^* =0.$$
Well, then since $b^*$ is in the dual vector space, for all $c\in \beta^*$, 
$$a_{c^*}=\sum_{b^*\in\beta^*} a_{b^*}b^*(c) =0(c)=0.$$
So all scalars must be zero, as required.
