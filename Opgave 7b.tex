\opgave{7b}{Show that $\End_k(k^2)$ is simple.}
We can identify $\End_k(k^2)$ with the $2\times 2$ matrices $M$. Suppose $I$ is an ideal of $M$ and $0 \neq A \in I$. Let $\alpha$ a non-zero entry of $A$. There exists matrices $E_1,E_2,E_3,E_4 \in M$ such that 
\[E_1 A E_2  + E_3AE_4 =
\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha  & 0\\ 
 0& 0
\end{pmatrix} +
\begin{pmatrix}
0& 0\\ 
 0& \alpha
\end{pmatrix}
\]

As $A$ in an ideal, this element must also be $I$, and as this matrix is diagonal, this element is invertible. Therefore $1\in I$ and $I=M$.
