\thm{Problem 2.3.15}{Let $V$ be a nonzero finite dimensional representation of an algebra $A$. Show that it has an irreducible subrepresentation. Then show by example that this does not always hold for infinite dimensional representations.}

If $V$ is irreducible, then we are done. If it is reducible, then there exists a subrepresentation $W$. As this subrepresentation is a subspace, $\dim(W) < \dim (V)$. If $W$ is irreducible, then we are done, if it is reducible, we continue the process. We are sure that this process will stop once, as all 1-dimensional subrepresentations are irreducible.
