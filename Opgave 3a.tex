\opgave{3a}{Show that if $A:V\to W$ and $B:U\to V$ are linaer maps, that $(AB)^t=B^tA^t$.}
First observe that $AB:U \to W$, $A^t:W^* \to V^*$, $B^t:V^* \to U^*$ and $(B^tA^t):W^* \to U^*$.
Let $u\in U$ and $w^* \in W^*$ then we need to show that
\[(AB)^t(w^*)(u)=(B^tA^t)(w^*)(u). \]
By definition this means that we need to show that:
\[w^*(AB(u))=(A^tw^*)B(u).\]
This holds as $(A^tw^*)B(u)=A^t(w^*)(Bu)=w^*(AB)(u)$.
