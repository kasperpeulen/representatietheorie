\opgave{1d}{Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $k$ vector space, and let $A = End_k(V)$. Show that
$œÅ = id_A$ defines a left $A$-module structure on $V$ , and show that $V$ is irreducible.}

We need to show that $(MN)v=M(Nv)$, which is surely true. To show that $V$ is irreducible, suppose that $W$ is a suprepresentation such that $MW \subset W$ for all $M \in End_k(V)$. But we can map $w \in W$ to every point in $V$, if we can choose any linear map $M: V \to V$, so $V$ must be irreducible.
